Original concept from my blog here https://learnwp.swiftdesigns.com.au/how-to-easily-align-your-woocommerce-shop-page-products/ where CSS has been used to apply hard rules. JavaScript allows for dynamic sizing and an overall easier implementation for product image sizing.

The images in this example will be square in shape. To apply the height so the images are rectangle add the required maths as shown in the code examples.
